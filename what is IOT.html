    <h1>What is the IoT? Everything you need to know about the Internet of Things right now</h1>
    <p><strong>What is the Internet of Things?</strong></p>
    <p>The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to the billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the internet, all collecting and sharing data. Thanks to the arrival of super-cheap computer chips and the ubiquity of wireless networks, it's possible to turn anything, from something as small as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-sensors-enabled-eli-lilly-to-improve-the-patient-experience/" target="_blank">a pill </a>to something as big as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ten-examples-of-iot-and-big-data-working-well-together/" target="_blank">an aeroplane</a>, into a part of the IoT. Connecting up all these different objects and adding sensors to them adds a level of digital intelligence to devices that would be otherwise dumb, enabling them to communicate real-time data without involving a human being. The Internet of Things is making the fabric of the world around us more smarter and more responsive, merging the digital and physical universes. </p>

    <p><br>  	<strong>What is an example of an Internet of Things device?</strong> </p>
    <p>Pretty much any physical object can be transformed into an IoT device if it can be connected to the internet to be controlled or communicate information.  </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/building-my-own-internet-of-things-ambient-experience-one-step-at-a-time/" target="_blank">A lightbulb</a> that can be switched on using a smartphone app is an IoT device, as is a motion sensor or a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/johnson-controls-cortana-powered-thermostat-is-up-for-preorder-in-march/" target="_blank">smart thermostat</a> in your office or a connected streetlight. An IoT device could be as fluffy as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-to-parents-beware-your-kids-smart-toy-could-be-a-security-risk/" target="_blank">a child's toy</a> or as serious as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/driverless-trucks-are-coming-but-for-now-adoption-is-in-the-slow-lane/" target="_blank">a driverless truck</a>. Some larger objects may themselves be filled with many smaller IoT components, such as a jet engine that's now filled with thousands of sensors collecting and transmitting data back to make sure it is operating efficiently. At an even bigger scale, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/las-vegas-announces-smart-city-plans-with-cisco/" target="_blank">smart cities projects are filling entire regions with sensors</a> to help us understand and control the environment.&nbsp; </p>

    <p>The term IoT is mainly used for devices that wouldn't usually be generally expected to have an internet connection, and that can communicate with the network independently of human action. For this reason, a PC isn't generally considered an IoT device and neither is a smartphone -- even though the latter is crammed with sensors. A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/could-your-apple-watch-save-your-life-how-smartwatch-sensors-are-helping-tackle-a-dangerous-heart/" target="_blank">smartwatch</a> or a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/fitbit-ionic/" target="_blank">fitness band</a> or other wearable device might be counted as an IoT device, however. </p>

    <p><strong>What is the history of the Internet of Things?</strong> </p>
    <p>The idea of adding sensors and intelligence to basic objects was discussed throughout the 1980s and 1990s (and there are arguably some <a href="https://innovateuk.blog.gov.uk/2017/07/03/the-history-of-internet-of-things-iot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">much earlier ancestors</a>), but apart from some early projects -- including an internet-connected vending machine -- progress was slow simply because the technology wasn't ready. Chips were too big and bulky and there was no way for objects to communicate effectively. </p>
    <p>Processors that were cheap and power-frugal enough to be all but disposable were needed before it finally became cost-effective to connect up billions of devices. The <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/rfid-heralds-the-internet-of-things/" target="_blank">adoption of RFID tags</a> -- low-power chips that can communicate wirelessly -- solved some of this issue, along with the increasing availability of broadband internet and cellular and wireless networking. The <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/finally-ipv6s-killer-app-the-internet-of-things/" target="_blank">adoption of IPv6 </a>-- which, among other things, should provide enough IP addresses for every device the world (or indeed this galaxy) is ever likely to need -- was also a necessary step for the IoT to scale.&nbsp; </p> <br><br><br>
    
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Ashton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component="externalLink">Kevin Ashton</a> coined the phrase 'Internet of Things' in 1999, although it took at least another decade for the technology to catch up with the vision.  </p>

    <p>"The IoT integrates the interconnectedness of human culture -- our 'things' -- with the interconnectedness of our digital information system -- 'the internet.' That's the IoT," Ashton <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/if-you-want-to-succeed-you-must-fail-first-says-the-man-who-dreamt-up-the-internet-of-things/" target="_blank">told ZDNet</a>. </p>
    <p>Adding RFID tags to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/uk-hospitals-embrace-rfid/" target="_blank">expensive pieces of equipment</a> to help track their location was one of the first IoT applications. But since then, the cost of adding sensors and an internet connection to objects has continued to fall, and experts predict that this basic functionality could one day cost as little as 10 cents, making it possible to connect nearly everything to the internet. </p>
