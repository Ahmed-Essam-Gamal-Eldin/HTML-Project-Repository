    <h1>Government regulation on IoT</h1>
    <p>One of the key drivers of the IoT is data. The success of the idea of connecting devices to make them more efficient is dependent upon access to and storage &amp; processing of data. For this purpose, companies working on the IoT collect data from multiple sources and store it in their cloud network for further processing. This leaves the door wide open for privacy and security dangers and single point vulnerability of multiple systems.<sup id="cite_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-154">[154]</a></sup> The other issues pertain to consumer choice and ownership of data<sup id="cite_ref-155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-155">[155]</a></sup> and how it is used. Though still in their infancy, regulations and governance regarding these issues of privacy, security, and data ownership continue to develop.<sup id="cite_ref-WeberInternet10_156-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WeberInternet10-156">[156]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-HassanInternet18-2_157-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HassanInternet18-2-157">[157]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-HassanInternet17_158-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HassanInternet17-158">[158]</a></sup> IoT regulation depends on the country. Some examples of legislation that is relevant to privacy and data collection are: the US Privacy Act of 1974, OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data of 1980, and the EU Directive 95/46/EC of 1995.<sup id="cite_ref-159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-159">[159]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Current regulatory environment:
    </p>
    <p>A report published by the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission" title="Federal Trade Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) in January 2015 made the following three recommendations:<sup id="cite_ref-160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <ul><li><a href="/wiki/Data_security" title="Data security">Data security</a> – At the time of designing IoT companies should ensure that data collection, storage and processing would be secure at all times. Companies should adopt a "defense in depth" approach and encrypt data at each stage.<sup id="cite_ref-161" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-161">[161]</a></sup></li>
        <li>Data consent – users should have a choice as to what data they share with IoT companies and the users must be informed if their data gets exposed.</li>
        <li>Data minimisation – IoT companies should collect only the data they need and retain the collected information only for a limited time.</li></ul>
        <p>However, the FTC stopped at just making recommendations for now. According to an FTC analysis, the existing framework, consisting of the <a href="/wiki/FTC_Act" class="mw-redirect" title="FTC Act">FTC Act</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Fair_Credit_Reporting_Act" title="Fair Credit Reporting Act">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act" title="Children's Online Privacy Protection Act">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</a>, along with developing consumer education and business guidance, participation in multi-stakeholder efforts and advocacy to other agencies at the federal, state and local level, is sufficient to protect consumer rights.<sup id="cite_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>A resolution passed by the Senate in March 2015, is already being considered by the Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup> This resolution recognized the need for formulating a National Policy on IoT and the matter of privacy, security and spectrum. Furthermore, to provide an impetus to the IoT ecosystem, in March 2016, a bipartisan group of four Senators proposed a bill, The Developing Innovation and Growing the Internet of Things (DIGIT) Act, to direct the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission" title="Federal Communications Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> to assess the need for more spectrum to connect IoT devices.
        </p>
        <p>Approved on 28 September 2018, Senate Bill No. 327<sup id="cite_ref-164" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-164">[164]</a></sup> goes into effect on 1 January 2020. The bill requires "<i>a manufacturer of a connected device, as those terms are defined, to equip the device with a reasonable security feature or features that are appropriate to the nature and function of the device, appropriate to the information it may collect, contain, or transmit, and designed to protect the device and any information contained therein from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure,</i>"
        </p>
        <p>Several standards for the IoT industry are actually being established relating to automobiles because most concerns arising from use of connected cars apply to healthcare devices as well. In fact, the <a href="/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration" title="National Highway Traffic Safety Administration">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) is preparing cybersecurity guidelines and a database of best practices to make automotive computer systems more secure.<sup id="cite_ref-165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>A recent report from the World Bank examines the challenges and opportunities in government adoption of IoT.<sup id="cite_ref-166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-166">[166]</a></sup> These include –
